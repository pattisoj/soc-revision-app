## Project Description

As a team of four we took time to understand our users (other bootcampers) and what would make their experience as junior developers easier. Our user research told us that a great way to help was with a revision app, so this is what we created.

The current repository is the accumulation of our efforts for the week.

**We coded for only three days during the project.**

On the Monday we sorted our team manifestos, how we were going to make decisions, understanding the brief and creating user personas, user journeys and wire-frames for our app.

On the Friday we had the pleasure of presenting and showcasing our app to industry professionals.

### This revision app provides:

- A home page with a bank of useful resource links, organised by category.
- A page to search for code snippets, either by category or randomly.
- A page to contribute your own resource links that then appear in the home page's resource bank.
